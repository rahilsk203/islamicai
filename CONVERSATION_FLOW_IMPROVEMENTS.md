# IslamicAI Conversation Flow Improvements

## Problem Identified
The IslamicAI application was not properly maintaining conversation context, causing it to revert to previous topics (like Gaza news) instead of following the natural conversation flow.

## Root Cause
While the session management system was correctly storing conversation history, the prompt construction wasn't effectively utilizing this context to maintain conversation continuity.

## Changes Made

### 1. Enhanced Prompt Construction in GeminiAPI
**File:** `src/gemini-api.js`
- Added explicit conversation context maintenance requirement to the prompt
- Added new requirement #6: "MAINTAIN CONVERSATION CONTEXT: Respond directly to the user's message while considering the conversation history provided in the context section"

### 2. Improved Simple Context Building
**File:** `src/advanced-session-manager.js`
- Added conversation context instructions to the simple context builder
- Added explicit guidance on how to maintain conversation flow

### 3. Enhanced Advanced Context Building
**File:** `src/advanced-session-manager.js`
- Added conversation flow instructions to the advanced context builder
- Improved guidance for maintaining natural conversation progression

### 4. Enhanced Personalized Context
**File:** `src/advanced-session-manager.js`
- Added conversation flow guidance to personalized context
- Added specific instructions about maintaining continuity and acknowledging references

### 5. Updated Base Prompt
**File:** `src/advanced-session-manager.js`
- Added additional conversation guidelines
- Enhanced instructions for building upon previous responses

### 6. Package Configuration
**File:** `package.json`
- Added "type": "module" to eliminate warnings and ensure proper module handling

## Expected Results
These changes should result in:
1. More natural conversation flow that follows the user's current topic
2. Better acknowledgment of references to earlier parts of the conversation
3. Reduced tendency to unnecessarily revert to previous topics
4. Improved context awareness in responses

## Testing
Created test scripts to verify:
1. Context building process
2. Session management functionality
3. Conversation flow improvements

The improvements focus on making the AI more contextually aware and better at maintaining natural conversation progression while still providing accurate Islamic guidance.
