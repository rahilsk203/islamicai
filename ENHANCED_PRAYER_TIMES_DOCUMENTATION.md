# Enhanced Prayer Times Implementation

## Overview

This document explains the enhanced prayer time functionality that now supports multiple calculation methods and provides detailed information about prayer time variations to the AI system.

## Key Features Implemented

### 1. Multiple Calculation Methods Support
- Support for 5 major calculation methods:
  - **Muslim World League (MWL)**: Used in Europe, Far East
  - **Islamic Society of North America (ISNA)**: Used in North America
  - **Egyptian General Authority**: Used in Egypt
  - **Umm al-Qura University, Makkah**: Used in Saudi Arabia
  - **University of Islamic Sciences, Karachi**: Used in Pakistan, India, Bangladesh

### 2. Enhanced Prayer Time Service
- New `getPrayerTimesWithMethods()` function that provides calculation method information
- Backward compatibility with existing `getPrayerTimes()` function
- Detailed method comparison data when needed

### 3. AI Context Integration
- Prayer time information automatically includes calculation method details
- Context-aware responses that explain method variations when relevant
- Proper Islamic references to support explanations

## Technical Implementation

### 1. LocationPrayerService Enhancements

#### New Calculation Methods Structure
```javascript
this.calculationMethods = {
  'MWL': {  // Muslim World League
    name: 'Muslim World League',
    fajr: 18,
    isha: 17,
    maghrib: 1, // minutes after sunset
    asr: 1, // 1 for standard, 2 for Hanafi
    midnight: 'standard'
  },
  'ISNA': {  // Islamic Society of North America
    name: 'Islamic Society of North America',
    fajr: 15,
    isha: 15,
    maghrib: 1,
    asr: 1,
    midnight: 'standard'
  },
  // ... other methods
};
```

#### Enhanced Calculation Function
```javascript
calculatePrayerTimes(location, date, timezoneOffset, method = this.defaultCalculationMethod) {
  // Get calculation parameters for the specified method
  const params = this.calculationMethods[method] || this.calculationMethods[this.defaultCalculationMethod];
  // ... calculation logic with method-specific parameters
}
```

#### New Method-Aware Function
```javascript
async getPrayerTimesWithMethods(location, date = new Date()) {
  // Try to get prayer times from Times Prayer website first
  // If successful, include method information
  // If not, calculate using multiple methods for comparison
  // Return detailed method information
}
```

### 2. Index.js Integration

#### Prayer Time Detection
```javascript
const prayerTimeKeywords = ['prayer time', 'namaz time', 'azaan time', 'prayer schedule', 
                          'fajr', 'dhuhr', 'asr', 'maghrib', 'isha', 'salah time', 
                          'prayer times today', 'when is', 'azaan', 'adhan', 'iqamah',
                          'next prayer', 'current prayer', 'prayer for today', 'namaz'];

const isPrayerTimeQuery = prayerTimeKeywords.some(keyword => lowerUserMessage.includes(keyword));

if (isPrayerTimeQuery) {
  const prayerTimes = await locationService.getPrayerTimesWithMethods(location, new Date());
  // Include method information in prayerTimesInfo
}
```

#### Enhanced Context for AI
```javascript
if (prayerTimesInfo) {
  contextualPrompt += `\n\n**Prayer Times Information:**`;
  contextualPrompt += `\nLocation: ${prayerTimesInfo.location.city}, ${prayerTimesInfo.location.country}`;
  contextualPrompt += `\nDate: ${prayerTimesInfo.date}`;
  contextualPrompt += `\nFajr: ${prayerTimesInfo.times.fajr}`;
  // ... other times
  contextualPrompt += `\nCalculation Method: ${prayerTimesInfo.calculationMethodName || prayerTimesInfo.calculationMethod}`;
  
  // Add note about variation in calculation methods when relevant
  if (query includes 'vary' or 'method') {
    contextualPrompt += `\n\nNote: Prayer times can vary slightly based on different calculation methods...`;
  }
}
```

## How It Works

### 1. User Query Processing
When a user asks about prayer times:
1. **Query Detection**: System identifies prayer time queries using keyword matching
2. **Location Detection**: Determines user location via IP geolocation
3. **Method-Aware Fetch**: Retrieves prayer times with calculation method information
4. **Context Integration**: Adds detailed prayer time information to AI context

### 2. AI Response Generation
The AI generates responses that:
- Provide accurate prayer times for the user's location
- Include calculation method information when relevant
- Explain variations in prayer times when users ask about them
- Maintain IslamicAI's characteristic friendly and knowledgeable tone

### 3. Example User Interactions

#### Basic Prayer Time Query
**User**: "What are the prayer times in Kolkata today?"

**AI Response**:
```
Assalamu Alaikum! 🤲

I'm providing you with the prayer times for Kolkata, India today:

**Today's Prayer Times (Kolkata, India):**
- 🕌 **Fajr:** 04:15
- 🌅 **Sunrise:** 05:29
- 🕏 **Dhuhr:** 11:26
- 🕐 **Asr:** 14:47
- 🕑 **Maghrib:** 17:20
- 🕒 **Isha:** 18:35

These times are sourced from timesprayer.org for your location.

📖 **Quranic Reminder:**
"Indeed, prayer has been decreed upon the believers a decree of specified times." (Quran 4:103)

May your prayers be accepted! 🌙
```

#### Query About Variations
**User**: "Why do prayer times vary in different places?"

**AI Response**:
```
Assalamu Alaikum! 🤲

You're asking an excellent question about why prayer times vary. There are several reasons:

1. **Geographical Location**: Prayer times are based on the position of the sun relative to your location. As you move north or south, east or west, the times change.

2. **Seasonal Changes**: The length of daylight changes throughout the year, affecting sunrise, sunset, and twilight times.

3. **Calculation Methods**: Different Islamic organizations use slightly different methods to calculate Fajr and Isha times:
   - **Muslim World League**: Fajr at 18° below horizon, Isha at 17°
   - **Islamic Society of North America**: Fajr at 15°, Isha at 15°
   - **University of Islamic Sciences, Karachi**: Fajr at 18°, Isha at 18°

These differences reflect varying scholarly interpretations (ijtihad) and regional practices.

📖 **Quranic Guidance:**
"Allah intends for you ease and does not intend for you hardship." (Quran 2:185)

Different communities follow the method that is most appropriate for their location and scholarly tradition.
```

## Benefits

1. **Accuracy**: Provides detailed information about calculation methods
2. **Educational**: Explains why prayer times vary to increase user understanding
3. **Transparency**: Clearly indicates the source and method of prayer times
4. **Flexibility**: Supports multiple calculation methods for different regions
5. **Backward Compatibility**: Maintains existing functionality while adding new features
6. **AI Awareness**: Ensures the AI understands and can explain method variations

## Testing

The implementation has been thoroughly tested with:
- Multiple calculation methods for various locations
- Backward compatibility with existing functions
- Context integration with the AI system
- Response generation for different query types
- Hinglish and English language support

All tests pass successfully, confirming the system works as intended.
