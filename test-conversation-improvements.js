// Test to demonstrate the improvements in conversation flow
console.log("=== IslamicAI Conversation Flow Improvements ===\n");

console.log("BEFORE the fix:");
console.log("- System would often revert to previous topics (like Gaza news)");
console.log("- Context wasn't properly maintained across conversation turns");
console.log("- User's current question wasn't always addressed directly\n");

console.log("AFTER the fix:");
console.log("- Added explicit conversation flow instructions in prompts");
console.log("- Enhanced context building with better guidance");
console.log("- Improved session management for maintaining history\n");

// Simulate the conversation flow
const conversationExample = [
  "User: hello kasa hai",
  "Assistant: Hello! Main theek hoon, shukriya poochne ke liye...",
  "User: ma bii thik huu", 
  "Assistant: Main bhi theek hoon, yeh sunkar achha laga!",
  "User: abii gaza maa halat kaya aaj kaa date maa",
  "Assistant: Gaza mein halaat abhi bhi bahut serious hain...",
  "User: iskaa kuch news sunaa",
  "Assistant: Current situation in Gaza remains dire...",
  "User: abii time kitnaa huu hai",
  "Assistant: Aap abhi ka time pooch rahe hain...",
  "User: next namza kaa time kitna maa hai bataa mara yaa"
];

console.log("Sample conversation:");
conversationExample.forEach(line => console.log(line));

console.log("\nWith our improvements, the response to the last message should be:");
console.log("Assistant: [Provides prayer times information based on user's location]");
console.log("            [Acknowledges it's a follow-up to the time question]");
console.log("            [Does NOT revert back to Gaza news]\n");

console.log("Key improvements made:");
console.log("1. Added 'Maintain Conversation Context' requirement to Gemini prompt");
console.log("2. Enhanced session context with explicit conversation flow instructions");
console.log("3. Improved personalized context with conversation guidance");
console.log("4. Added conversation context instructions in simple context building");
console.log("5. Specified module type in package.json to eliminate warnings\n");

console.log("These changes should result in more natural, context-aware conversations");
console.log("where the AI properly maintains the conversation flow and doesn't");
console.log("unnecessarily revert to previous topics.");
