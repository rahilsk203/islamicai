I'm providing you with the prayer times for Kolkata, India today:

**Today's Prayer Times (Kolkata, India):**
- üïå **Fajr:** ${prayerTimesWithMethods.times.fajr}

Assalamu Alaikum! ü§≤

You're asking an excellent question about why prayer times vary. There are several reasons:

1. **Geographical Location**: Prayer times are based on the position of the sun relative to your location. As you move north or south, east or west, the times change.

2. **Seasonal Changes**: The length of daylight changes throughout the year, affecting sunrise, sunset, and twilight times.

3. **Calculation Methods**: Different Islamic organizations use slightly different methods to calculate Fajr and Isha times:
   - **Muslim World League**: Fajr at 18¬∞ below horizon, Isha at 17¬∞
   - **Islamic Society of North America**: Fajr at 15¬∞, Isha at 15¬∞
   - **University of Islamic Sciences, Karachi**: Fajr at 18¬∞, Isha at 18¬∞

These differences reflect varying scholarly interpretations (ijtihad) and regional practices. The times I provided for Kolkata are based on the method used by timesprayer.org, which is widely accepted.

üìñ **Quranic Guidance:**
"Allah intends for you ease and does not intend for you hardship." (Quran 2:185)

Different communities follow the method that is most appropriate for their location and scholarly tradition.

Assalamu Alaikum! ü§≤

You're asking about the calculation method used for prayer times. For Kolkata, the times I provided are sourced from timesprayer.org, which uses a method that is widely accepted in the region.

Different calculation methods exist because:
1. **Scholarly Interpretation**: Scholars have different opinions on the exact angles for Fajr and Isha
2. **Regional Practices**: Different regions may have established local traditions
3. **Practical Considerations**: Some methods are more suitable for certain latitudes

The main methods in use are:
- **Muslim World League (MWL)**: Used in Europe, Far East
- **Islamic Society of North America (ISNA)**: Used in North America
- **University of Islamic Sciences, Karachi**: Used in Pakistan, India, Bangladesh
- **Umm al-Qura University, Makkah**: Used in Saudi Arabia

For Kolkata, the timesprayer.org method is appropriate for your location.

üìñ **Hadith Guidance:**
"The differences of opinion among my Ummah are a mercy." (Hadith)

This shows that variation in non-fundamental matters is acceptable in Islam.
