# IslamicAI Authentication and Memory System Implementation Summary

## Overview

This document summarizes the implementation of user authentication and memory features for the IslamicAI system. The enhancements include:

1. User authentication with email/password and Google Sign-In
2. Personalized memory system with short-term and long-term storage
3. User preference management (language, madhhab, interests)
4. Memory recall and context injection in AI responses
5. Memory clearing functionality

## Key Components Modified

### 1. Auth Manager (`src/auth-manager.js`)

Enhanced to:
- Support email/password and Google Sign-In authentication
- Create default user preferences on signup/login
- Manage user profiles with login tracking

### 2. D1 Memory Manager (`src/d1-memory-manager.js`)

Enhanced to:
- Manage user preferences (language, madhhab, interests)
- Store discussion summaries for long-term memory
- Track user profiles with login information
- Provide memory profile retrieval

### 3. Index (`src/index.js`)

Enhanced to:
- Integrate authentication and memory features
- Add new API endpoints for user management
- Inject user preferences and memory into AI context
- Include user information in responses

### 4. Advanced Session Manager (`src/advanced-session-manager.js`)

Enhanced to:
- Better integrate user preferences into base prompt
- Improve context building with user-specific information

## New API Endpoints

### Authentication
- `POST /auth/signup` - Sign up with email and password
- `POST /auth/login` - Login with email and password
- `POST /auth/google` - Login with Google ID token

### User Preferences
- `POST /prefs/update` - Update user preferences (language, madhhab, interests)
- `POST /prefs/clear` - Clear specific preference field
- `POST /profile/update` - Update user profile information

### Memory Management
- `GET /memory/profile` - Get user's complete memory profile
- `POST /memory/clear` - Clear all user memories and preferences

### Chat
- `POST /api/chat` - Get AI response (direct)
- `POST /api/stream` - Get AI response (streaming)
- `POST /` - Get AI response (streaming by default)

## Database Schema Updates

### User Authentication Tables
- `users` - Core user information
- `user_auth` - Password hashes for email/password users
- `user_profiles` - User profile information with login tracking

### Memory Storage Tables
- `user_preferences` - User preferences (language, madhhab, interests)
- `discussion_summaries` - Compressed discussion summaries for long-term memory

## Implementation Details

### Authentication Flow
1. Users sign up or login to receive a JWT-like token
2. Token is used in Authorization header for authenticated requests
3. User data is automatically created/linked in D1 database

### Memory System
1. Short-term memory: Session-based conversation context
2. Long-term memory: D1-stored user preferences and discussion summaries
3. Memory recall: Injected into AI context for personalized responses
4. Memory clearing: Users can clear all preferences and memories

### User Preferences
1. Language preference (English, Hindi, Bengali, Hinglish)
2. Madhhab preference (Hanafi, Shafi'i, etc.)
3. Interest tracking (Fiqh, Tafsir, Islamic history, science)

### Context Injection
1. User preferences are automatically added to AI prompt context
2. Recent discussion summaries provide conversation continuity
3. User profile information enhances personalization

## Security Considerations

1. Passwords are securely hashed using PBKDF2 with 100,000 iterations
2. Authentication tokens use HMAC signing for verification
3. Google ID tokens are validated for audience and basic payload structure
4. All sensitive data is filtered before being sent to AI or client

## Performance Optimizations

1. LRU caching for frequently accessed data
2. Efficient database queries with proper indexing
3. Memory deduplication to avoid repeated processing
4. Streaming responses for better user experience

## Future Enhancements

1. Enhanced memory clustering and categorization
2. Improved preference learning algorithms
3. Advanced privacy controls for memory management
4. Cross-session memory linking
5. Memory export/import functionality
