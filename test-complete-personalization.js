The number of Rakats varies by prayer:\n\n**Fajr (Dawn):** 2 Rakats Fard\n**Dhuhr (Noon):** 4 Rakats Fard\n**Asr (Afternoon):** 4 Rakats Fard\n**Maghrib (Sunset):** 3 Rakats Fard\n**Isha (Night):** 4 Rakats Fard\n\nAdditionally, there are Sunnah Rakats before and after some prayers.

Here are some practical tips:\n\n1. **Preparation:**\n   - Make Wudu with mindfulness\n   - Dress appropriately and cleanly\n   - Choose a quiet, clean place\n\n2. **During Salah:**\n   - Understand what you're reciting\n   - Recite slowly and clearly\n   - Reflect on the meanings\n   - If your mind wanders, gently bring it back\n\n3. **Spiritual Preparation:**\n   - Remember you're standing before Allah\n   - Think of Salah as direct communication\n   - Ask Allah for focus before starting\n\nThe Prophet Muhammad (ﷺ) said: \"The closest a servant comes to his Lord is when he is prostrating, so say much supplication.\" May Allah help you achieve khushu in your Salah."

      user: "That's helpful! I'd love to learn more about the spiritual benefits of Salah. Can you elaborate?",
      ai: "Beautiful question, Abdullah! The spiritual benefits of Salah are profound and transformative:\n\n**Direct Connection with Allah:**\nSalah is our direct line of communication with our Creator, five times a day.\n\n**Spiritual Purification:**\nEach Salah washes away sins. The Prophet (ﷺ) said: \"The five daily prayers, Friday to Friday, and Ramadan to Ramadan make atonement for what is between them, as long as major sins are avoided.\"\n\n**Strengthening Faith:**\nRegular Salah reinforces our relationship with Allah and strengthens our Iman.\n\n**Inner Peace:**\nAllah says in the Quran: \"Indeed, by the remembrance of Allah do hearts find rest.\"\n\n**Community Bonding:**\nCongregational prayers create unity and brotherhood among believers.\n\n**Discipline and Structure:**\nSalah instills discipline that affects all aspects of life.\n\nMay Allah make your Salah a source of light, guidance, and peace in your life!"

      user: "Sometimes I feel guilty when I miss a prayer. How should I handle these feelings?",
      ai: "Your feelings of guilt, Abdullah, show your strong connection with Allah and your sincere desire to please Him. This is actually a positive sign of faith. Here's how to handle these feelings:\n\n**Immediate Response:**\n- Make sincere repentance (Tawbah)\n- Make up the missed prayer as soon as possible\n- Resolve not to repeat the mistake\n\n**Long-term Approach:**\n- Don't let guilt overwhelm you - this can lead to despair\n- Remember Allah's infinite mercy and forgiveness\n- Use the experience as motivation to be more consistent\n- Make a practical plan to avoid missing prayers\n\n**Remember:**\nAllah says: \"And He is the Oft-Forgiving, the Most Merciful.\" Your guilt shows you care, but don't let it distance you from Allah. Instead, let it bring you closer through sincere repentance and renewed commitment.\n\nThe Prophet (ﷺ) said: \"The one who repents from sin is like one who has no sin.\" May Allah accept your repentance and make you steadfast."
