# Duplicate Function Fix

## Issue
There was a duplicate member "getResponseInstructions" in the AdaptiveLanguageSystem class:
- First instance at line 619
- Second (duplicate) instance at line 744

This was causing a warning during compilation:
```
[b] open a browser [d] open devtools [c] clear console [x] to exit
▲ [WARNING] Duplicate member "getResponseInstructions" in class body [duplicate-class-member]

    src/adaptive-language-system.js:744:2:
      744 │   getResponseInstructions(detectedLanguage, adaptationInfo = {}) {
          ╵   ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

  The original member "getResponseInstructions" is here:

    src/adaptive-language-system.js:619:2:
      619 │   getResponseInstructions(language, adaptationData = {}) {
          ╵   ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
```

## Solution
Removed the duplicate function at line 744, keeping only the original implementation at line 619.

## Verification
After the fix, there is now only one instance of `getResponseInstructions` in the file, eliminating the duplicate member warning.
