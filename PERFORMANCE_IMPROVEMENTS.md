# Performance and Security Improvements Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes the improvements made to the IslamicAI backend to ensure stable performance, strong security, and efficient search handling during long conversations.

## Key Improvements

### 1. Enhanced API Key Management
- Implemented intelligent cooldown period for failed API keys (5 minutes)
- Added performance tracking for each API key
- Improved load balancing with round-robin distribution
- Added metrics tracking for success/failure rates

### 2. Optimized Search Tool Usage
- Refined logic to include Google Search tool only when truly necessary
- Implemented confidence-based triggering for search requests
- Added performance metrics tracking for search operations
- Reduced redundant processing by relying more on Gemini's built-in search

### 3. Improved Performance Monitoring
- Added request timing metrics
- Implemented cache hit tracking
- Added search trigger counting
- Created performance metrics APIs for monitoring

### 4. Enhanced Security Measures
- Strengthened privacy filtering
- Added additional sensitive pattern detection
- Improved session data sanitization
- Enhanced response filtering for technical information

### 5. Efficient Data Processing
- Optimized cache management with TTL-based expiration
- Reduced search timeout values for faster responses
- Limited search results for quicker processing
- Implemented performance metrics tracking

## Configuration Details

The system now uses the exact configuration specified:
- Model: `gemini-2.5-flash-lite`
- API Endpoint: `https://generativelanguage.googleapis.com/v1beta/models/gemini-2.5-flash-lite:streamGenerateContent`
- Generation Config: `thinkingConfig.thinkingBudget: 0`
- Tools: Google Search tool included only when needed

## Test Results

Testing shows the system correctly identifies when real-time data is needed:
- General Islamic knowledge: No search tool included
- Current information requests: Search tool included
- Prayer times: Search tool included
- News requests: Search tool included
- Historical questions: No search tool included
- Science questions: No search tool included

## Performance Metrics

The system now tracks:
- Total requests processed
- Successful vs failed requests
- Average response time
- Search requests triggered
- Cache hit rates
- Processing time statistics

These improvements ensure the system maintains stable performance during long conversations while providing accurate and reliable information, especially for science-related topics, with an Islamic perspective when relevant.
